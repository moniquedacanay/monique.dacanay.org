				<h3>Parallel Computing Continued</h3>
				<h4>Day 17: April 14, 2018</h4>
				<p> Today, we learned about how the number of dependencies contribute to how 
				much communication is needed. For example, if there are less dependencies, then 
				less communication is needed. Also, we learned about algorithms. They are sets of 
				operations/instructions, that computers follow. They are like recipes. Also, 
				I learned that they have to be very detailed and specific. We also learned 
				that nature is also parallel. For example, trees grow at the same time. In addition,
				we learned that not everything is a model can be parallel and some must be done in 
				a series. </p>

				<h3>Group Project Number Two Presentations and Parallel Computing</h3>
				<h4>Day 16: April 7, 2018</h4>
				<p> Today, we presented our projects. After everyone presented, we all got 
				feedback from Levi and the other officers about our projects. In addition, 
				after all the presentations, Aaron gave us an introduction to parallel computing. 
				We learned that different devices have different numbers of cores. For example,
				a dual-core has two cores, while a quad-core has four separate processors. Also,
				we learned that having more cores is very useful, because it makes it so that 
				 the chips don't melt. In addition, the cores work together. In addition, 
				 we learned that serial workers are less productive than parallel workers. We 
				 saw this in the model of coin flippings of the serial and parallel workers. 
				 We learned a lot today!</p>

				<h3>Working on Group Project Number Two</h3>
				<h4>Day 15: March 17, 2018</h4>
				<p> Today, we continued to work on our group project. We worked on our Agent Cubes
				Model and tried to finalize everything. Mr. Aaron and Mr. Ernie helped us by 
				answering our questions, which helped us make our model even better. They helped
				us understand how to solve problems, like making fire fighters 
				only disappear when there are no more burning trees, and making burning trees,
				which turn to healthy trees, then back again to burning trees, only change to 
				healthy and stay healthy, unless they are beside another burning tree. In this
				situation, they told us that we need to set burn to zero, so that the healthy
				tree won't turn to a burning tree right after it just turned healthy, even 
				when it is not next to another burning tree. Mr. Aaron and Mr. Ernie helped 
				us a lot in our projects, and we learned a lot from doing these projects. We 
				learned a lot today on how to fix certain problems, and improve our models.</p>

				<h3>Continuation of Group Project Number Two</h3>
				<h4>Day 14: March 10, 2018</h4>
				<p>Today, we continued to work on our group project number two. We planned 
				our if/then statements, and we started working on how to solve the nearest 
				neighbors problem. Mr. Aaron helped us understand how to solve this problem, 
				and he said that we need two methods, a check method and a change method. In 
				those methods, there are rules. To make an agent only change the nearest neighbors 
				for each time step, I learned that you had to write certain rules, in which let 
				only the nearest neighbors change. In addition, after planning, we got approval
				from Mr. Aaron, and we started implementing our plan in our burning forest model,
				for agent cubes. </p>

				<h3>Group Project Number Two</h3>
				<h4>Day 13: March 3, 2018</h4>
				<p>Today, we started our group project number two. We first picked our 
				partners for the project, then we read over our group project requirements.
				After, we started our project. We followed the process of 
				planning first, then getting approval, then implementing. Kaylene and I first 
				wrote out our story and an extension for our "Burning Forest Model". After, 
				we got approval from Mr. Aaron. Next, we made the agents and shapes for our 
				model, and got approval again. After, we wrote our if/then rules, and got 
				approval once again. Last of all, we did our reflections, and blogs.</p>

				<h3>Functions, Objects, and Libraries</h3>
				<h4>Day 12: February 17, 2018</h4>
				<p>Today, we learned about functions, objects, and libraries. We learned that
				functions are blocks of code we can give names to. We also learned that 
				libraries are sets of code people put together, so other people can use it.
				Also, Agent Cubes is graphical and has lots of clicking and dragging.
				In addition, we learned about refactoring which is changing how code is written, 
				without changing how in behaves. We also learned about black boxes and 
				white boxes. Black boxes behave a certain way, and we do not know how it works. 
				In addition, we learned about the graphical interface or GUI, and how an 
				example of a GUI is bouncing particles. We also learned that a repository 
				is a place where you can get lots of code. We learned a lot today!</p>

				<h3>Project Euler and Solving Problems with Loops, Conditions, and Arrays</h3>
				<h4>Day 11: February 10, 2018</h4>
				<p>Today, we extended our knowledge of operations, types, and types of operands.
				Also, we learned about Project Euler. We learned that in Project Euler, we
				solve problems computationally. When solving problems, first, we need to think 
				in Pseudocode, then in regular code. If we were a computer what would we do to solve this? 
				We learned that we have to think ourselves as human computers. We also learned 
				about arrays, loops, and conditions. We learned that loops are very helpful, 
				because you do not have to write many lines of code. In addition, we learned 
				in Java Script, one equal sign means an assignment, and you have to use two 
				equal signs to make something equal to something else. In addition, we learned 
				that optimization is reducing the things we have to keep track of. We learned a lot today!</p>

				<h3>Programing Concepts</h3>
				<h4>Day 10: February 3, 2018</h4>
				<p>Today, we learned about many programming concepts. We learned the three 
				step process. In the three step process, you change/edit, save, and run the
				 model. Also, we learned about many tools we need to program. Tools we need 
				 are code, the text editor, a computer, documentation, documentation, a 
				 programmer, a programming language, problem solve, and an end user. In 
				 addition, we learned lots of key terms, like syntax and semantics. Mr. 
				 Aaron also taught us about the data types, which are number, boolean, and
				  string. Last of all, we learned about the operator, the operand, and the operation. We 
				  learned many different things today! </p>

				<h3>Working on the Project</h3>
				<h4>Day 9: December 16, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, we continued working on our website and our modeling projects. We added descriptions to our agent models, and more steps to our systems project (Vensim). We also learned more tips for presenting. We learned that it is not good to sway your body while you are presenting. Also, if you don't feel comfortable and you don't know what to do with your hands, you can just hold your hands together, behind your back. In addition, we learned that it is good to have graphs in both Agent Cubes and Vensim, so when you present, you can compare the graphs. Also, we learned that we should include sources in our project. It is important to include them, so we can back up our facts, and where we got our information, to support our projects. Another good tactic for presenting is to look at your audience. You should not just look at the board, but you should also make eye contact with your audience. In addition, we learned that we should project our voices when we present. We learned many things from the presentations.  </p>

				<h3>The Continuation of Project Work</h3>
				<h4>Day 8: December 9, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, I continued working on my modeling projects. I added the equations to my systems model. Also, later in my next step, I added algae to my model. For my system model, I also added graphs to my models. In Agent Cubes, I made a model with fish, and fishermen in the sea. I made it so that when the fishermen touch the fish, the fish would disappear. In addition, I made some corrections to my website where the project material would go. Last of all, I did my reflections, and my blog. </p>

				<h3>The Two Frameworks, System Modeling, and Agent Modeling</h3>
				<h4>Day 7: December 2, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, Dr. Panoff taught us about the two frameworks. He told us that 
				one of the frameworks was to peel the onion, and take away everything except
				what you need to start off with, then later put the layers back. He also, 
				told us that "learning about the world is like onions". The second framework 
				was that knowledge is like a pearl. The natural pearl starts with the oyster, 
				then sand enters the oyster. After, the oyster gets irritated. It secretes 
				and coats, secretes and coats, and repeats over and over again until it 
				forms a pearl. In other words, it is like starting with a simple idea, then
				adding more to it, layer after layer. I also learned that the steps to 
				modeling is to find what exists, then what acts, then what interacts. After, 
				we started our group project. We first took notes about our projects, then 
				proceeded with our project. First Caroline and I drew a plan of our systems 
				model. After, we started planning for our agent model. At the same time, 
				we started making our Agent Cubes model. Finally, we did our reflections, 
				and blogs.</p>

				<h3>Three Views, Change & Behavior, Two Species population model, and Agent Cubes</h3>
				<h4>Day 6: November 18, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, Dr. Panoff taught us about the three views. He told us that they were approaches for learning. The three views are preview (expectation), view (observation), and review (reflection). He also taught us about change and behavior and how they can affect each other. We learned that there are four types, which are 0 change gives us a horizontal linear line, constant change which gives us a linear line, linear change, which gives us a quadratic, and proportional change, which gives us exponential. We also learned about two species population models. We learned that we first had to make the separate models, then connect the two. In addition, we learned that system modeling starts with change, while agent modeling starts with behavior. Dr. Panoff also, taught us how to use Agent Cubes to make agent models. We used the five steps to create the model. In addition, we learned that the story is very important in agent modeling and three important things to include in it are nouns, verbs, and adjectives. I really enjoyed using Agent Cubes to make agent models, and it was really cool to be able to actually see the healthy people turn sick as they interact with sick people. </p>

				<h3>Have=Had+Change and System Thinking Models</h3>
				<h4>Day 5: November 11, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, Dr. Panoff taught us about "have=had+change". He said that we can use this formula to model information. Also, he told us that the "had" and "have" are measurements, and "change" is important. It can either mean what you have goes up or what you have goes down. Dr. Panoff also told us about semantics. He said it is the meaning of symbols. We also learned about system thinking models. Four important parts of system models are variables, box variables, arrows, and the rate. We use these things to make models of different kinds. In addition, we learned that exponential growth is a result of proportional change. </p>

				<h3>Modeling, the IF statement, and Computational Thinking</h3>
				<h4>Day 4: November 4, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, Dr. Panoff taught us about modeling. He told us that there are different types of modeling, and that models are not unique. Also, models don't mean the same thing every time. Some of the different types of models are deterministic, stochastic, iterative, and much more. Also, in models, information goes in and out. For models, you have to pick the right tool for the right task. For example, in hand waving models, it is better to use hands, rather than your head. We also learned about sandboxes, and how you make stuff in it ,and all the stuff you make in the sandbox stays in the sandbox. In other words, it is isolated. Also, Dr. Panoff taught us that the if statement is important. Last of all, we used "=RAND()" to get random numbers for things. After, if we need more information, we need to hit "command =" to calculate the entire spread sheet again. In addition, we learned that nothing does not equal zero. Zero has value, while nothing doesn't.</p>

				<h3>Computational Thinking</h3>
				<h4>Day 3: October 21, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, Dr. Panoff taught us about computational thinking. We learned that if you change the representation, or "manipulate" it, it can change the meaning of it. Also, it can make it easier to understand. We learned about algorithm and that every word could have a meaning. In addition, there is more than one way to calculate something. Dr. Panoff taught us that information is just a noise. Last of all, we learned that breadcrumbs tell you how you got to a place. For example, the breadcrumb on the Interactivate website showed us how we got to the histogram or the multi-function data flyer.</p>

				<h3>Ethics and the Three Steps of Learning</h3>
				<h4>Day 2: October 14, 2017</h4>
				<p>Today, Mr. Ron taught us about ethics. We learned that we have to dress for the occasion, be fragrant, we can't have relationships, no horse play allowed, we need to communicate well, and more. Also, from Dr. Panoff we learned about the acquisition of human knowledge. He taught us about expectation, observation, and reflection. We also learned that Excel's formating makes the numbers round up, so you have to put the equation in parentheses to get the true answer. Dr. Panoff taught us that Google is not trust worthy and that we have to ask ourselves "How do you know?". With this we have to check where Google got the information we see and explain why we believe it. He also told us about computational thinking and said that it can mean to access and retrieve information, not just computing information.</p>

				<h3>Learning More About the Shodor Apprenticeship Program</h3>
				<h4>Day 1: October 13, 2017 (Make up for October 7)</h4>
				<p>Today, Aaron taught me more information about the Shodor Appprenticeship program. He took me on a tour around the Shodor building and showed me where all the staffs rooms, storage rooms, the breakroom, lunch room, and the fire extinguishers were. He also, taught me how to log into the computer and reset and change my password. Mr. Aaron showed me how to get to the Shodor website, Shodor Wiki, the page with all the projects and voice/ screen recordings.</p> 
				
				<p>To catch up for October the 7th, I listened to the recordings and completed the makeup work.</p>
