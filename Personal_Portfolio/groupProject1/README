Please use this folder as a template for your group project. All group members
should do the following:

1. Upload this folder to your public_html folder on the Shodor login server.
2. Make sure the website appears when you go to the following page (replace
   yourusername with your Shodor username):
   http://shodor.org/~yourusername/groupProject1
3. Open the three .html files in a text editor (e.g. Atom or TextWrangler) and
   follow the instructions written in comments (lines that start with <!--).
4. As you make changes, make sure you upload them back to the server and test
   them by refreshing http://shodor.org/~yourusername/groupProject1
5. If you wish to change the colors and/or border sizes of the website you can
   do so in the main.css file.
6. The .png and .mdl files are just provided as examples; you should replace
   these with your own.
