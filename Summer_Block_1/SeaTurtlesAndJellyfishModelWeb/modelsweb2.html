        <h3>Model Description</h3>
        <p>This project models the sea life of sea turtles and jellyfish. Two versions of the project were
        created; the first uses AgentCubes, and the second uses Vensim. </p>
    </section>

    	<h3>The Story</h3>

       
        
    	<p>If a jellyfish (pink square) is next to one or more sea turtles (green square), 
    	then there is a percent chance, (simulation property, EATEN_PCT_CHANCE) that the 
    	jellyfish will be eaten by the sea turtle.

		If a jellyfish is next to one or more jellyfish, there is a percent chance, (simulation 
		property, JELLYFISH_REPRODUCTION) that a new jellyfish will be born.

		If a sea turtle is next to one or more sea turtles, there is a percent chance, (simulation 
		property, SEATURTLE_REPRODUCTION) that a new  sea turtle will be born.

		If a sea turtle is next to one or more plastic items (grey square), then there is a percent 
		chance, (simulation property, DEATH_PCT_CHANCE) that the sea turtle will die or disappear 
		from the ocean. 

		There is a percent chance, (simulation property, PLASTIC_WASTE_ACCUMULATION) that another 
		plastic will appear in the ocean.
		
		There is a percent chance, (simulation property, PLASTIC_PICK_UP) that the plastic 
		will be "picked up" by a sea turtle protection organization, or humans, which want 
		to clean the environment. This will cause the plastic to disappear from the ocean.
		
		There is a percent chance, (simulation property, ASEXUAL\_REPRODUCTION) that a new 
		jellyfish will be born.

		There is a percent chance, (simulation property, DEPENDANT\_TURTLE\_DECREASE) that the turtle 
		population will decrease if the jellyfish population is less than one. This is because the 
		sea turtle is dependant on the jellyfish population for food, and if the jellyfish population 
		decreases, so will the sea turtle population.

		There is a percent chance, (simulation property, DEPENDANT\_TURTLE\_INCREASE) that the turtle 
		population will increase if the jellyfish population is equal to or more than seven and the 
		sea turtle population is less than or equal to five. This is because the sea turtle population 
		is dependant on the jellyfish population. If the jellyfish population increases, or becomes 
		very high, there would be more jellyfish for the sea turtles to eat, causing the sea turtle 
		population to also rise.


		Plastic moves randomly in the ocean. 

		Jellyfish moves randomly in the ocean. 

		Sea turtles move towards jellyfish. 

		A counter (purple square) counts the number of sea turtles, jellyfish, and plastic there 
		are in the ocean, and graphs the population sizes. 

		To change any of the simulation properties, click the gear button at the top left part of 
		the screen. Then, in the menu that appears, click show simulation properties. In the simulation 
		dialog box, you can change any values and you can see what are the properties, in which 
		affect the model.

    <h3>Observed Behaviors</h3>

       
        <p>In the models, jellyfish and sea turtles swim in the ocean. Sea turtles try to
        look for jellyfish, but sometimes, accidentally eat plastic instead. If they do eat the 
        plastic or they come in contact with it, there is a percent chance that they will die.
        Also, jellyfish can give birth to more jellyfish, when they come in contact with another 
        jellyfish. In the same way, sea turtles can give birth to more sea turtles, when they interact
        with other sea turtles. These models show how both populations depend on each other, 
        and affect each other in many ways. In the graph, you can see that one population would rise,
        while the other would fall, and the opposite would also later occur. The other population
        would start to rise, while the first population would fall. For example, if the sea turtle
        population rose, then this would cause the jellyfish population to decrease. Eventually,
        the sea turtle population would compete with each other for food (jellyfish), and their 
        population would decrease, because of natural selection. When the sea turtle population decreased,
        the jellyfish population would increase again, because of lack of predators. This would cycle, 
        with both populations going up and down. In the models, the jellyfish and plastic bags, would
        move randomly in the world, while the sea turtles would hunt for them (jellyfish). 
        Like in the real world, sea turtles may mistakenly eat a plastic bag, thinking it was 
        jellyfish, since they both look very similar to each other. In addition, in this model,
        there is a percent chance that more plastic will appears in the ocean.   </p>

        <h3>How to Run</h3>

       
        <p>Once the model is opened, to run the model, click the run simulation button, located 
        at the top-left of the screen. The run simulation button has an arrow on top. After 
        you click play, the model will automatically start and run until it finishes. 
		You can click the back arrow at the top of the screen to get back to the Play, Design, Edit page.
		In addition, you can even change how fast or slow the model runs. To do this, just slide the 
		slider bar, located on the top-right of the screen. You can also click the stop, and step 
		simulation buttons to control and run the model. Another option is to reload the world, which makes 
		the world load back to its normal form.  </p>

        <h3>Observation Using Different Scales</h3>

        <p>Some observations I had were that on a smaller world, similar results occurred but 
        on a smaller scale. Also, analyzing the graph, I saw that the motions of the populations
        were more drastic, and went up and down a lot, but like in the bigger world, they both
        ended up dying at the end and they also showed the relation between both populations,
        and how if one population rises the other falls. </p>
    </section>
    
    
     <section> 
        <h3>Pushing the Limits</h3>

        <p>To push the limits I added two different types of reproduction for the jellyfish: 
        sexual and asexual reproduction. This made my model more realistic, because like real
        jellyfish, the ones in my model also could reproduce both ways. This was tricky to do at 
        first, but after a couple tries it finally worked! I added a simulation property, so 
        my users can easily change the values of how much or how little they want the rate 
        of asexual reproduction to go. 
        
        I also had to push the limits by changing my model so it would stop when not only one 
        of my agent populations died (either sea turtles or jellyfish), but instead both populations.
        This was tricky to do because of course when one population died off the other population
        would increase and continue to increase. After many edits I was able to add simulation 
        properties in which allowed one population to fall, after the other population was really 
        low, and it allowed one population to rise, if under certain conditions.

        <h3>What I Learned by Adjusting Parameters</h3>

        <p>I learned that when you adjust your parameters by a little bit, it 
        can make a big difference. For example, when I tried adjusting the sea turtle reproduction simulation
        property, by .5, it made the difference between having the population rise or fall. 
        Also, I learned by adding different simulation properties and adjusting other ones can 
        help the graph not go too high and like in the real world, make the populations go up
        and down. As one population rises, the other falls.</p>

        <h3>Screenshots</h3>

        <p>In this screen shot, it shows the model before it has ran.</p>
        <img src="End_SeaScreen.png" style="width:870px;height:375px;" alt="Sea Life AgentCubes"/>
        
        <p>This screen shot, shows the model after it ran. You
        can observe that both population affect each other, and when one population rises, the 
        other falls. For example, if there were a lot of sea turtles, then they would be competing 
        and fighting for food (jellyfish), this will cause the jellyfish population to decrease
        over time. After a while, when the jellyfish population dropped, the sea turtle population
        would also start to decrease, because of lack of food. Once the sea turtle population 
        decreased, again, the jellyfish population would increase, as the predators decreased.
        This would cause the populations to keep on rising and falling one after the other. This
        is demonstrated in this graph, showing as one population falls, the other rises.

    	<h1>Vensim Model</h1>
    	
        <h3><a href="Sea_Turtles_and_Jellyfishyes2.mdl"
          target="_blank">Link to Vensim Model</a></h3>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Open and Run Vensim</h3>

       
        <p>To open this system model, you need to have Vensim downloaded on your computer. 
        You can download Vensim, by going to: http://vensim.com/free-download/.

		To open this vensim model, click on the "Link to Vensim Model" link above. In Vensim, click 
		the SyntheSim button in the top-center part of the screen. The button is a small gray box with 
		a green arrow on it. In the SyntheSim mode, you can change the parameters of factors, like a 
		sea turtles birth or death rate, a jellyfish birth or death rate, human littering factors, and 
		much more. Changing these parameters allow you to see how they influence the sea turtles and 
		jellyfish populations. The quantities of sea turtles, jellyfish, and plastic bags are shown
		on a graph to the right side of the screen. The graph will change as you change the parameters 
		of the factors. </p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Change Vensim Parameters</h3>

     
        <p>To change the parameters, drag the bar below each factor in the model. Like stated 
        above, this will affect the graph displayed to the right of the screen. </p>

    </section>
        <section> 
        <h3>Pushing the Limits</h3>

        <p>To push the limits I added the plastic variable to the model. This contributed to 
        the death or decrease of sea turtles, which also affected the other population. This 
        was really cool because like the real world it demonstrated that sea turtles really
        accidentally eat plastic, mistaking it for jellyfish.  
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h3>What I Learned by Adjusting Parameters</h3>

        <p>I learned that each factor can make a big difference and impact all populations.
        I also was able to see how it may be in real life with one factor impacting others 
        whether in positive or negative ways.</p>
    </section>
  
    
    <section>
        <h3>Vensim Screenshot</h3>

       
        <img src="SeaVensimScreenShot.png" style="width:900px;height:500px;" alt="Vensim"/>
         <p>This screenshot, shows my Vensim Sea Life model. By looking at the graph to the side of the model,
         you can see that both populations affect each other in many ways. Also, their populations
         cycles, going up and down. In other words, sea turtles and jellyfish both depend on each other. 
         For example, if the sea turtles population grows rapidly, this would cause the jellyfish
         population to decrease, because of too many sea turtles eating the jellyfish. Later, the
         sea turtle population would compete with each other for food, and their population would decrease. 
         Eventually, the jellyfish population would soon rise, caused by fewer predators eating
         them. Like stated above, the populations rise and fall one after another.

    <section>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>

        
        <p>I learned that two or more populations can greatly affect each other. Like stated before,
        if the sea turtle population rose, then this would cause the jellyfish population to
        decrease. Later, competition between many sea turtles will result in the decrease of
        sea turtles, and the increase of jellyfish. This would cycle continuously, having one
        population rise, and the other fall. I also learned that many different factors can 
        result in the deaths of different organisms. For example, the plastic bags in these models
        hurt the sea turtle populations and made them decrease. In research, other factors like 
        starvation, old age, body injury, suffocation, and other things can result in the deaths
        of organisms.</p>
