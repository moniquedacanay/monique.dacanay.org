        <h1>Model Description</h1>
        <p>This project models the sea life of sea turtles and jellyfish. Two versions of the project were
        created; the first uses AgentCubes, and the second uses Vensim. </p>

        <h1>The Story</h1>

        <!-- Write the model story into the paragraph below. Make sure the -->
        <!-- story includes your extension. -->
        <p>If a jellyfish (pink square) is one of the nearest-neighbors of a sea turtle 
        (green square), it will test the wave direction (a simulation property, WAVE_DIRECTION 
        -- 0 means north, 1 means south, 2 means east, 3 means west). If the jellyfish is 
        downward from the sea turtle, there is some percent chance (simulation property, 
        HIGH_PCT_CHANCE) that the jellyfish will be eaten by the sea turtle. If the jellyfish 
        is NOT downward from the sea turtle, there is a different percent chance (simulation 
        property, LOW_PCT_CHANCE) that the jellyfish will still be eaten by the sea turtle.
         
        Also, plastic (gray square) can appear in the world caused by human littering 
        (humans not actually shown in the model). If the sea turtle eats or comes in contact 
        with the plastic, then there is some percent chance, (simulation property, DEATH_PCT_CHANCE) 
        that the sea turtle will die or disappear from the ocean. 
        
        If a jellyfish is next to another jellyfish, there is some percent chance, (simulation 
        property, REPRODUCTION_PCT_CHANCE), that another jellyfish will be born, or appear in the 
        ocean.
        
        If a sea turtle is next to another sea turtle, there is some percent chance, (simulation 
        property, REPRODUCTION_PCT_CHANCE), that another sea turtle will be born, or appear in the 
        ocean.
		
		Plastic appears randomly in the ocean.
		
		Plastic moves randomly in the ocean.
		
		Jellyfish moves randomly in the ocean.
		
		Sea turtles move towards jellyfish and plastic, when hungry.
		
		A counter (purple square) counts the number of sea turtles, jellyfish, and plastic there 
		is in the ocean, and graphs the population sizes.

To change any of the simulation properties, click the gear button at the top left part of 
the screen. Then, in the menu that appears, click show simulation properties. In the 
simulation dialog box, you can change any values and you can see what are the properties, 
in which affect the model.

        <h1>Observed Behaviors</h1>

        <!-- Explain the behaviors of the overall system and the graph. -->
        <!-- Focus on what you can see the system doing and why you think -->
        <!-- it is doing it and what you can see the graph is doing and why -->
        <!-- you think it is doing it. -->
        <p>In the models, jellyfish and sea turtles swim in the ocean. When hungry, sea turtles try to
        look for jellyfish, but sometimes, accidentally eat plastic instead. If they do eat the 
        plastic or they come in contact with it, there is a percent chance that they will die.
        Also, jellyfish can give birth to more jellyfish, when they come in contact with another 
        jellyfish. In the same way, sea turtles can give birth to more sea turtles, when they interact
        with other sea turtles. These models show how both populations depend on each other, 
        and affect each other in many ways. In the graph, you can see that one population would rise,
        while the other would fall, and the opposite would also later occur. The other population
        would start to rise, while the first population would fall. For example, if the sea turtle
        population rose, then this would cause the jellyfish population to decrease. Eventually,
        the sea turtle population would compete with each other for food (jellyfish), and their 
        population would decrease, because of natural selection. When the sea turtle population decreased,
        the jellyfish population would increase again, because of lack of predators. This would cycle, 
        with both populations going up and down. In the models, the jellyfish and plastic bags, would
        move randomly in the world, while the sea turtles would hunt for them (jellyfish and plastic bags). 
        Like in the real world, sea turtles may mistakenly eat a plastic bag, thinking it was 
        jellyfish, since they both look very similar to each other. In addition, in this model,
        plastic appears randomly in the ocean (caused by human littering).   </p>

        <h1>Nearest-Neighbors </h1>

        <!-- Explain how you ensured that only the nearest neighbors burn -->
        <!-- in a single time step, rather than a large chunk of the forest. -->
        <p>I ensured that only the nearest neighbors get eaten, by broadcasting a jellyfish check and 
        change. This makes it so that only the nearest neighbors get eaten, because in one time 
        step, instead of seeing that the sea turtles are beside jellyfish and eating them, or 
        making them disappear, it sets the food of the jellyfish beside the sea turtle 
        to one, then after, in the broadcast jellyfish change, it will test if the food of the 
        jellyfish is set to one. If it is, then the jellyfish will then get eaten by the sea 
        turtle. This prevents too many jellyfish, or in other words, only the nearest neighbors 
        to get eaten by sea turtles. This is very important in making only those jellyfish right beside the 
        sea turtle(s) to get eaten. </p>

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>

        <!-- Explain what you learned from this project about forest fires, -->
        <!-- modeling, programming, and anything else you learned. -->
        <p>I learned that two or more populations can greatly affect each other. Like stated before,
        if the sea turtle population rose, then this would cause the jellyfish population to
        decrease. Later, competition between many sea turtles will result in the decrease of
        sea turtles, and the increase of jellyfish. This would cycle continuously, having one
        population rise, and the other fall. I also learned that many different factors can 
        result in the deaths of different organisms. For example, the plastic bags in these models
        hurt the sea turtle populations and made them decrease. In research, other factors like 
        starvation, old age, body injury, suffocation, and other things can result in the deaths
        of organisms.</p>
