			<h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Monique Dacanay. I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am 15 years old and I study at Leesville Road High School. I have been in Leesville since elementary until now! Also, I am a 9th grader. Currently, I am taking Spanish 2, Biology, Math 3,and Microsoft Word and Powerpoint. In school, I am involved in Key Club, Speech and Debate, Book Club, and FCA. I am interested in swimming, playing badminton, playing the violin, doing arts and crafts, drawing, and much more! In my free time, I enjoying playing the violin. Right now, I am playing a piece, by Haydn, called Concerto No. 2 in G Major. Playing the violin is very fun, and it is a way to take all the stress away. I am a part of the Raleigh Community Orchestra, and I also volunteer to help tutor the 6th grade orchestra after school. Last year I got in All State, which was a really cool experience, to be able to play with the best of the best. I also love spending time with my family. I have a big brother named Michael. Together, as a family, we like to play board games, like Pictionary, watch movies, cook together, and more. In addition, we love traveling. Over Spring break, we went to Tennessee. In Tennessee, we visited Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. In Pigeon Forge, we went to DollyWood. We had so much fun watching the shows, eating different kinds of food, from many cultures, and riding a variety of rides. Ending our trip, we drove to Asheville. This trip was very memorable, and I hope to go back to Tennessee and Asheville soon! At Shodor, I am an apprentice for the 2017-2018 year. I joined Shodor to gain more knowledge about computer science, essential office and life skills. I enjoy going to Shodor. It is very fun, because I not only get to spend time with my fellow apprentices, but I also have opportunities, to model, make websites, use different and new languages and softwares, like HTML, CSS, AgentCubes, Vensim, and more!</p>

			<h2>ACROSS EACH DEVICE</h2>
			<p>There were a few key points made above that I want to reiterate in closing. First, even though page layout definitely isn’t necessarily
			a “one size fits all” practice, there is a science to it that can be quickly and easily applied in an incredibly vast number of circumstances.
			Next, the layout ideas presented above need not result in cookie cutter websites that all look the same, but instead merely provide you with a
			basic canvas on which to build a notably unique finished design.  Finally, the key to successfully implementing these ideas is to remember
			that they’re not set in stone. Each should be changed to fit your specific project and can even be mixed and matched to create new ideas!</p>
